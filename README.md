# EV Charging Demand Forecast ðŸš—âš¡

This Jupyter Notebook forecasts EV (Electric Vehicle) charging demand using historical vehicle registration data in India. The project includes:

- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning (Random Forest & Linear Regression)
- Forecasting EV percentage
- Saving and exporting model

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Joblib (model export)

## ðŸ“„ File
- `EV_VEHICALE_CHARGE_DEMAND.ipynb`: main notebook with entire analysis

## ðŸ“ˆ Goal
To build a predictive model that estimates future EV penetration in the market.
